# Snake Game Unity 

Classic Snake game built with Unity Engine. Game uses simple 2D sprites for snake, food and score multiplier. Collisions are also used for detecting when snake hits the food or the mulitplier or obstacles. There is basic UI like simple menu and UI elements for life and score. There are some little bugs here and there but nothing dramatic.
